# Let Me Here

Letmehere is a lightweight block sitting mod.

## Why Another Block Sitting Mod?

Letmehere does **not** bind the `use` key as the key for sitting. For the following reasons:

1. Convenient and nature to sit without facing a chair.
2. No filter needed for blocks to sit on and items in hands.

Other features:

1. Sit anywhere or the center of the block along the XZ axis.
2. Optional client installation provides a sitting keybind.

## Command

- `/sit` Make the executor sit in a position choosen as follows: If there is a stair block behind the executor that is of the bottom type and faces in a different direction, use the center of the stair block. Otherwise use the executor's position.
- `/sit [<location>] [<align>]` Make the executor sit in a certain position.

## Keybind

- `Z` Send chat command `/sit`.
